# Hey there, I'm Samhith!

I like to code, and recently...

### What/who got me into coding?

The simple answer is [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). They have inspired me to code and make software projects, as well as hardware ones.  

In the 8 or so months that I've been in this community that supports teenagers coding, I've had 5 PCBs funded from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), and a good portion of the software projects on my GitHub page are Hack Club related.

## What do I like to program/make
In my projects, I like to make low level/embedded stuff if I can. I love hardware projects, and Hack Club enables me to do so (I especially love PCB design)!
In the past, I did stuff with Python and very simple machine learning/training projects, but I have taken a break from that as my interests have changed (maybe you can see me give it another shot in my other projects/repositories)!
