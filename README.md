What/who got me into coding?:

The simple answer is [hacklub](https://hackclub.com/), they have inspired me to code and make software projects, as well as hardware ones. In the 8 or so months that I've been in this community that supports teenagers coding, I've had 5 PCB's funded from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), and a good portion of the software projects on my GitHub page are Hack Club related.
